# To copy all files into the build directory.
grunt build

# Copy all contents from the build directory into Google drive. Copying index.html is optional but doesn't hurt.

# index.html needs to be deployed onto Google App Engine. So copy it into the deploy directory.
grunt prepare_deploy

# Go to the deploy directory and fix the import statements (for javascript, css etc.) to point to Google drive locations instead of relative paths.

# Open Google Cloud SDK Shell (C:\Program Files\Google\Cloud SDK) and deploy the application.
