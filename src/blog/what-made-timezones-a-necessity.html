					<span class="heading-color1">How did time zones come to be?</span>
					<p class="lead text-justify">
						People have been measuring time long before time zones were adopted, sun dials being the most popular instruments.
						The measurements were usually based on sunrise and sunset with noon being the Sun's zenith. This served people well
						over centuries as long as the societies remained largely isolated. With the advent of trade by ships, different times
						in different regions started becoming a problem but the problem was barely noticeable because of the slow travel times
						and the long durations between stops.
					</p>
					<span class="subheading-color2">The advent of steam engine</span>
					<p class="text-justify">
						The advent of steam engine and telecommunications was a different story though. Rail roads enabled people to move at
						speeds not seen before and telecommunications enabled almost instantaneous connection. Use of local times started becoming
						awkward and confusing as a result. For railway passengers and rail road managers especially, time differences turned out
						to be a serious problem. At that time, the United States had more than 300 different local times in each city. Imagine
						scheduling a train that crosses several cities in a single day or even worse, traveling a few hundred miles through these
						cities. It was such a big problem that the rail road managers devised their own time zone system by establishing about
						hundred rail road time zones. This can be seen as the first attempt at standarding time zones.
					</p>
					<p class="text-justify">
						Meanwhile, Britain faced with a similar problem adopted a single standard time across England, Scotland and Wales. The
						United States took a cue from this system and came up with four standard time zones for contintental United States on
						November 18, 1883. These countries later worked with other countries and eventually arrived at an international consensus
						for global time zones in1884.
					</p>
					<span class="subheading-color2">Why not a single time zone?</span>
					<p class="text-justify">
						Now, one might ask why don't we use a single time across the globe. Why can't it be 9 P.M. every where when it is 9 P.M.
						in the USA?
						While that would have prevented this hassle of converting across time zones, it comes with its own set of problems. Humans
						(and many other animals) have an inbuilt circadian rhythm which is largely controlled by sun light. No matter how we measure
						time, humans will wake up at sun rise and retire at sun set because of the circadian rythm.
					</p>
					<p class="text-justify">
						Now, if we had a single time zone (lets call it <em>GlobalTime</em>), we would then have to remember that people in the
						USA sleep at <em>9 P.M. GlobalTime</em> whereas people in India go to work at <em>9 P.M. GlobalTime.</em> In other words,
						if you need to schedule a phone call with a person in India, you will have to think about whether or not <em>9 P.M. GlobalTime</em>
						is an appropriate time to call someone in India. On the contrary, with the current time zone system, we know that American
						sleep at 9 P. M. PST and Indians sleep at 9 P. M. IST.
					</p>
					<p class="text-justify">
						As confusing as time zones can get, you know where to look when you need to <a href="http://timezonemate.com">convert between
						time zones!</a>
