                                                The skill is not designed to track, read, or otherwise snoop on you or your email, and it does not intentionally store anything for future use except for the time stamp that you last used this skill on your Alexa device. This data is used to prevent Alexa from reading email that has already been presented to you.
					</p>
					<p class="test-justify"> 
						The main purpose of the Email Preview skill is to connect two systems you already use 1) Amazon Alexa (probably an Echo or Dot or Fire TV device) and 2) the email service offered by Google.  The skill temporarily stores authentication information of your email account to be able to provide a preview of your email through the Alexa interface.  To do this it accesses Amazon and Google services, each with its own privacy policy.  This page only describes the Email Preview skill itself, not the privacy policies of Google and Amazon, which are available on the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201809740">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">Google</a> web sites. 
					</p>

					<p class="test-justify">
						The specific services used by this Skill include:

						<ul><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201809740">Amazon Alexa</a> (your echo or other device uses this each time you speak to it)</ul>
						<ul><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/run-code-cloud/">Amazon AWS Lambda</a> (the place where the program for this skill runs)</ul>
						<ul><a href="https://www.google.com/gmail/">Google Gmail</a> – to get your messages, the skill requires read access to your email account.  The skill does not request permission to permanently delete messages or modify your email account in any which way.</ul>
						<ul><a href="https://www.google.com/script/start/">Google Apps Scripts</a> – This is a Google site where some of the skill’s program runs, to help link the different Google services together.  In using the skill, you authorize it to process and access the same Google services above (Gmail).</ul>
					</p>

					<p class=test-justify">
                                 		All of the email related information being used by this skill stays in your Google account, and can only be accessed using the authorization info you provide while linking the skill and your email accounts. You can revoke the access to your email account at any time by either disabling the skill on Alexa or by revoking access to Alexa from the list of authorized apps on your Google account. 
The skill stores the time stamp to indicate the last time you accessed the skill in a database. This information is used solely to determine at point to start reading the email from. This information is stored only as long as the skill is enabled and is removed permanently every time the skill is disabled. The skill doesn’t track its users in anyway once the skill has been disabled by the user.
