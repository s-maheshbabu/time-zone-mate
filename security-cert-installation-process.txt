# Will ask for domains to be secured. Enter (without quotes) "timezonemate.com www.timezonemate.com"

# You will be asked for a secure string to be put in a secure file on the domains being protected. This will be asked twice, once for timezonemate.com and then again for www.timezonemate.com. It is better to collect all security strings first and then make changes to app.yaml. Just hit enter after getting the first security string to get the second one. 
# It is in the format <security_string> at http://www.timezonemate.com/.well-known/acme-challenge/<first_security_string_file_name>
# For ex, it might ask to put yt91keilxuWSafKRSpQvG7SW_1H07TR-0mXtfVagQW8.jSGTHrJETl9__uPFToCvRbiH6i2-6g9GxwuxGpfwO8A at http://www.timezonemate.com/.well-known/acme-challenge/yt91keilxuWSafKRSpQvG7SW_1H07TR-0mXtfVagQW8

# Change directory into time-zone-mate project.
